# Navigate to the project directory (replace 'path_to_project' with your project's path)

cd path_to_project

# Activate your Python virtual environment (if you have one)

source venv/bin/activate # This is for Unix systems. Use 'venv\Scripts\activate' for Windows.

# If you do not have a virtual environment yet follow along

    cd path_to_project
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate for Windows.
    source venv/bin/activate for Unix systems
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Deactivate the virtual environment:
        When you are finished and want to exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate.

# Install the required packages

pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming you have a requirements.txt file with the necessary packages.

# Run the application using Uvicorn (assuming your FastAPI app instance is in 'app.py' and named 'app')

uvicorn app:app --reload

# Now, your application should be running, and you can access it via http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.
